# AutoML with Flaml - Credit Score vs. Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) simplifies the machine learning workflow, automating various steps from data preprocessing to model deployment. This repository demonstrates the application of AutoML using the Flaml library. While AutoML can achieve high accuracy in credit score prediction, challenges arise when handling imbalanced data, leading to lower accuracy in heart disease prediction.
